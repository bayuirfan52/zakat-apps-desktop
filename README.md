## Getting Started

This project was built using:
- flutter versi `v3.7.11`
- `GetX` ecosystem.
- `VelocityX` A minimalist Flutter framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- `Dio` REST API client

---

### Documentation
- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
- [GetX](https://chornthorn.github.io/getx-docs/index)
- [VelocityX](https://velocityx.dev/docs/install)

### Development Guidelines :
- Design Pattern **MVC**
- Because using `linter`, before committing, make sure to check `Dart Analysis` count = 0, keep clean code as recommended by flutter.

---

### Before we start, let's Set-Up tools / install below:

- **get_cli** : terminal : `pub global activate get_cli` atau `dart pub global activate get_cli`
- **plug-in : getXSnippet** vscode / intellij
- **dart line** : set line to 200, so that the reformatting code remains neat. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36602270/142856350-d62bfe1b-7af2-43de-8455-ace88a92078e.png)

### PENTING!!
- to make a new page, run in terminal : `get create page:test_page`
- run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build` first!
